* "Mendelessly"
  My academic literature management (reading, organizing, note-taking).

* Softwares
  Although all the scripts are (technically "IS" at the moment, I
  know) and will be written with the assumption that emacs/org-mode is
  being used, allowing them to work with other markup formats should
  be trivial to achieve with zero to a small number of
  modifications. That said, emacs/org-mode offers an insanely
  efficient system for editing, organizing, note-taking, aso, which is
  the only reason for these scripts to be marginally yet
  significantly useful, as far as I can tell.

  Now here are the softwares I use for literature management in a
  daily basis:
  - editor: emacs, especially org-mode
  - file manager: ranger (optional)
  - pdf reader: zathura (optional) 

* Usage
** org-lit-sync
   - a project folder
     - literature pdf's
     - org-lit-sync
     - a .org file with the last heading as "Unread" (you might wanna
       check out [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFO2UbzbZhA][this video]] to get the hang)
   - run the script with the new added pdf as the single argument
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     ./org-lit-sync year-author-title.pdf
     #+END_SRC
     it will
     - append the new pdf at the bottom of the .org file under the
       "Unread" heading
     - create a org link to open the pdf
     - sort all the unread papers chronically
       - if you want to sort papers by author name, just bulk name the
         papers with format: "author-year-title.pdf"
       - using macro to bulk rename
   - recommendations
     - I have my ranger equipped with a keybinding
       #+BEGIN_SRC shell
	 map mpo shell mv -v %s /**/project-folder && cd /**/project-folder && ./org-lit-sync %s
       #+END_SRC
       so that the flow goes as
       - download the pdf
       - change the name following the pattern
       - call the ranger keybinding
       - and it's ready in the .org file with unread heading and
         well-sorted
     - You can of course use shell aliases or something like that
